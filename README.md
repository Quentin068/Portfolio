# Quentin Mesnel-Terreau's Portfolio

This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio, designed to showcase my background, skills, and projects as a Big Data & AI engineering student.

The website is fully static, built from scratch without any frameworks, using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (ES6+).

## ✨ Features

*   **Clean & Modern Design:** A minimalist interface with a focus on typography and user experience.
*   **Bilingual:** A language switcher (French/English) to cater to an international audience.
*   **Terminal Easter Egg:** Press the 'T' key to discover a hidden terminal.
*   **Fully Responsive:** The layout adapts to all screen sizes, from mobile to desktop.
*   **Modular Structure:** The code is organized into reusable components (HTML, CSS, JS) for easy maintenance.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

*   **HTML5**
*   **CSS3:**
    *   CSS Custom Properties (Variables)
    *   CSS Grid & Flexbox
    *   Animations
*   **JavaScript (Vanilla JS):**
    *   ES6 Modules
    *   DOM Manipulation
    *   Fetch API for HTML component inclusion.

## 📂 Project Structure
